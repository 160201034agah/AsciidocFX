==== Features

* Big news, AsciidocFX salutes markdown users! As of 1.3.4, It facilitates users to open/edit/delete markdown documents along with its features as well as to convert markdown documents to asciidoc documents thanks to https://github.com/rahmanusta[Rahman Usta], by https://github.com/asciidocfx/AsciidocFX/blob/master/src/main/resources/public/js/marked-extension.js[extending] the https://github.com/chjj/marked[marked] framework.
* Users can transfer their https://www.gitbook.com/[Gitbooks] to Asciibooks. You can find this service from the ellipsis section in the file browser. In order start this service, after selecting your existing gitbook directory you need to give another empty directory in which the corresponding asciidoc files will be located.
* Our another useful handy framework called " https://github.com/asciidocfx/highlight-treeview.js[treeview] syntax highlighting" is now utilized. We give you two choices to make your own filesystem view.

* "Paste" and "Paste Row" options; If the copied content is HTML, you will be given two choices before pasting the content into the editor.
* Since AFX supports two markup languages, users can choose which markup languages they want to use in each "new *" tab at startup. (By default, Ascidoc is selected).
* The editor toolbar includes new facilities for users who want to easily adapt and use Asciidoc features such as blocks, admonitions (e.g. tip), document helpers (e.g. appendix), and extensions AFX itself provides.

* Markdown File extension association provided.
